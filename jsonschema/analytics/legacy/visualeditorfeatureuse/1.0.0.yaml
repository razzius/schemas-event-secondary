  Basic data on the use of various tools and feature provided by the
  VisualEditor. You can join it with Schema:EditAttemptStep data to enrich with
  user- and session-level data; as of May 2020, some of this is duplicated into
  this schema as well. For living dictionary of current values, see

      external client-sent instrumentation events, we want to allow meta.dt to
      be the received time (filled in by EventGate at ingest time), as we don't
      trust client-sent events to always set the proper date and time.
      Client-set event generation time should be set here instead. See:
