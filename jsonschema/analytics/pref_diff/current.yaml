description: >-
  Represents a user preference change that initiated from a user submitting the
  user preferences form. This is slightly different from the prefupdate schema
  in that it logs an arbitrary `intial` and `final` state (e.g. a user switched
  from latest Vector to Monobook). It also allows for the use of a hashed user
  ID. Please see T261842 for more info on its initial use case.
