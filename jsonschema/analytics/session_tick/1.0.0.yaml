title: analytics/session_tick
description: >
  Each active user session sends its current length at a pre-determined time
  interval called a 'tick'. When a user session becomes inactive, it stops
  sending length updates. If it remains inactive long enough, it will be reset.
  If it re-activates before being reset, the backlog of length updates will be
  sent, and it will resume sending length updates as before.

  Used to compute a privacy-conscious session length metric, see

      external client-sent instrumentation events, we want to allow meta.dt to
      be the received time (filled in by EventGate at ingest time), as we don't
      trust client-sent events to always set the proper date and time.
      Client-set event generation time should be set here instead. See:
