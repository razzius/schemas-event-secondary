title: analytics/session_tick
description: >
  Each active user session sends its current length at a pre-determined time
  interval called a 'tick'. When a user session becomes inactive, it stops
  sending length updates. If it remains inactive long enough, it will be reset.
  If it re-activates before being reset, the backlog of length updates will be
  sent, and it will resume sending length updates as before.
  
  Used to compute a privacy-conscious session length metric, see
