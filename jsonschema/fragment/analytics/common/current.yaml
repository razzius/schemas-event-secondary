      ISO-8601 formatted timestamp of when the event occurred/was generated
      in UTC). This exists separately from meta.dt in the main common
      schema. For external client-sent instrumentation events, we want to
      allow meta.dt to be the received time (filled in by EventGate at
      ingest time), as we don't trust client-sent events to always set the
      proper date and time. Client-set event generation time should be set
      here instead. See: https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T240460
