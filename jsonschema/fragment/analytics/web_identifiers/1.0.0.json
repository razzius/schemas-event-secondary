A session ID is generated the first time it is requested by the instrumentation code, which is usually the first time the user visits the website.\nIn the current implementation, this ID is shared across windows, tabs, and page views in the same browser. The ID is normally regenerated after the browser is shut down; however, if the browser's \"restore previous session\" feature is used when it restarts, the previous ID is retained.\nInteractions across multiple pages in the same web session may be linked together via this identifier.\nInstrumentation code should assign this with mw.user.sessionId()\n"

Different visits to the same page will yield different pageview IDs (also called tokens).\nInteractions with multiple features (instrumented separately) on the same web page may be linked together via this identifier.\nInstrumentation code should assign this with mw.user.getPageviewToken()\n"
