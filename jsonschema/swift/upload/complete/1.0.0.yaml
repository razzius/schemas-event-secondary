      Swift API URI which should be requested in order to get the list of
      objects for this upload complete event.  In the case where this event
      represents a full directory upload is complete, the URI will have
      ?prefix=<swift_object_prefix>.  In the case that this event only
      represents a single object from a larger directory upload, this will have
      ?prefix=<swift_object_prefix>/<full_path_to_object>.  In either case,
      requesting this URI will get you a list of objects relevant to this event.
