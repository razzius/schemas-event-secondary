          Swift API URI which should be requested in order to get the list of objects for this
          upload complete event.  In the case where this event represents a full directory upload
          is complete, the URI will have ?prefix=<swift_object_prefix>.  In the case that this
          event only represents a single object from a larger directory upload, this will
          have ?prefix=<swift_object_prefix>/<full_path_to_object>.  In either case,
          requesting this URI will get you a list of objects relevant to this event.
